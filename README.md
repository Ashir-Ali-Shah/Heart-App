Heart Disease Prediction App ‚ù§Ô∏è
A comprehensive web application for predicting heart disease risk using machine learning, built with Streamlit and featuring interactive visualizations.
üéØ Overview
This application uses a trained Logistic Regression model with advanced feature engineering to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on 13 medical parameters. The model incorporates polynomial features, interaction terms, and binning techniques to achieve optimal prediction accuracy.
‚ú® Features

Interactive Web Interface: User-friendly form for inputting medical parameters
Real-time Predictions: Instant heart disease risk assessment with probability scores
Advanced Visualizations:

Risk factor analysis charts
Probability gauge displaying risk percentage
Interactive plots using Plotly


Comprehensive Risk Assessment: Identifies specific risk factors and provides detailed analysis
Medical Recommendations: Tailored advice based on prediction results
Professional UI: Modern, responsive design with medical-grade styling

üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture
The prediction model includes sophisticated feature engineering:

Interaction Features: Age-cholesterol interaction, heart rate-age ratio
Binning: Age and cholesterol level categorization
Polynomial Features: Second-degree polynomial features for continuous variables
Standardization: Feature scaling for optimal model performance
